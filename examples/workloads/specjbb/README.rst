Building
========
To build docker image from Dockerfile you need to add specjbb into this directory.
Specjbb is not an open source project: You need to buy a license.

Unarchive file with specjbb2015 and move the specjbb directory to SpecJBB directory of this
repository.
As a result we should have ./Specjbb/specjbb directory with, among others files, specjbb2015.jar.

Build docker image from the root directory of the repository.
